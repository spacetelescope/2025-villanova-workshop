    "Dr. Nefarious, ever the thorn in astronomy’s side, has unleashed his latest scheme: he’s corrupted the headers of key TESS FITS files! Without those headers, the data is nearly unreadable, and astronomers everywhere are left staring at scrambled numbers instead of discovering new worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission, Agent, is to dive into these files and restore order. With the power of `astropy.io.fits`, you’ll learn to peel back the layers of TESS data products, decode the headers, and reveal the precious light curves and pixel data hidden within.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every header keyword you unlock, every column you expose, brings you one step closer to foiling Dr. Nefarious’s plan and securing the archive."

    "## Opening a Target Pixel File\n",
    "\n",
    "TESS (the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) looks for planets by watching stars get slightly dimmer when a planet passes in front of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of taking one huge picture of the whole sky, TESS also downloads small cutouts called Target Pixel Files (TPFs). Each TPF is like a little movie of a star, where each “frame” is called a cadence (about 2 minutes long). TPFs are used to analyze the brightness variations of stars over time, which can reveal phenomena such as transiting exoplanets, stellar variability, and other astrophysical events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive in, let’s define a few important terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sector: TESS observes the sky in large strips. Each strip is called a sector (about a month of data).\n",
    "\n",
    "- HDU (Header Data Unit): A FITS file is made up of “units” that contain either data (like an image) or metadata (information about the observation).\n",
    "\n",
    "- BJD (Barycentric Julian Date): A standard time system used in astronomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- TBJD (TESS BJD): A simpler version of BJD, offset by 2457000.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cadence: The time between measurements (2 minutes for TPFs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looking Inside a TPF\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's load in a TPF. Normally, we would search for this file through the MAST Archive, but to keep things simple, we'll just open it directly from the cloud. This TPF is for the star AU Mic. After loading the file to memory, we can use the `info` method to examine its structure."
